Pseudo code for the MC simulations

-) create a point lattice where each point represents a dimer
    remark: The topology is conform with hexagonal symmetry
-) connect the west/east and north/south edge to create a torus
-) Define reaction correlations between neighboring anthracene pairs and dimers
-) Define how these correlations influence the reaction propability
-) create a graph (as in graph theory) of the neighbors of each dimer pair
-) run the simulation with a given reaction propability and run length
    -> go over each pair and modifiy the reaction propability according to the correlations
    -> Check against a random number if a reaction occurs and if so remember the location
    -> when all locations are checked, change the state of the previously determined locations to "reacted"
    -> repeat until the end of time is reached
